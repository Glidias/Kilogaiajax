<div>
	Some stupid content here without HTML header. 
	<br/>This URL should not be accessed directly but through a template. Mod-rewrite would help in this case.
	<!-- As you can see, this html page has no html header. Still possible to load in raw HTML content without html template. Just make sure all content is enclosed in 1 root div -->
